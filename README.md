# Disney Movies and Lego Sets Analysis
By: Genesis Guardado & Rosemary Medina-Casanova

# Project Description
This repository contains code for analyzing the correlation between the popularity of Disney movies and the creation of Lego sets. The analysis is conducted using Python and various data manipulation and visualization libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.The motivation behind this project is to explore whether the success of Disney movies influences the production of Lego sets based on those movies. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights into consumer preferences and market trends in the entertainment and toy industries.

## Dataset

- **Disney Movies Dataset**: The dataset includes information about Disney movies, including their titles, release dates, genres, MPAA ratings, total gross, and inflation-adjusted gross. This data is sourced from [Data.World](https://data.world/).

- **Lego Sets Dataset**: The dataset consists of information about Lego sets, including their names, descriptions, list prices, piece counts, and review difficulties.
- This data is sourced from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mterzolo/lego-sets)

## Analysis

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The Disney movies dataset and Lego sets dataset are cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent formatting.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - The popularity of Disney movies is explored by analyzing total gross and inflation-adjusted gross.
   - Lego sets related to Disney, Marvel Super Heroes, and Star Wars themes are identified.
   - Various visualizations, such as count plots and histograms, are created to explore the distribution of themes and genres.

3. **Correlation Analysis**: The correlation between the popularity of Disney movies and the creation of Lego sets is examined.

## Code

The analysis code is written in Python and is available in the Jupyter Notebook format (`disney-legos.ipynb`). It includes step-by-step explanations and comments to facilitate understanding.

## Dependencies

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
